# What is this service about?

This service was created by Intellivoid,
the VPN Servers available in OpenBlu are not hosted by
Intellivoid but rather a small community of volunteers from which
OpenBlu discovers and lists here publicly on this Web Application

Any issues with VPN Servers are not the responsibility of
Intellivoid.

This service is provided entirely for free without any
applied restrictions other than your own limitations, 
you should be able to connect to **ANY** VPN Server for free
using any device using a OpenVPN Client. Intellivoid will never
charge for access to OpenBlu VPN Servers.

The only paid services from OpenBlu is API Access which allows
developers to write clients that retrieves server listings from
OpenBlu and individual server configurations. The purpose
of the API is just to retrieve information from OpenBlu's
publicly available VPN Servers.

If you want to keep this service alive and see future improvements
you should consider donating to Intellivoid or purchasing an API
Subscription.
